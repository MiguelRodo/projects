# GitHub Project administration

Treat the user's request as the desired outcome. Do not require the user to repeat the operating procedure in this skill.

## Select the skill and local contract

1. Find the target repository root.
2. If `.projects/skills/github-project-admin/SKILL.md` exists there and is not this skill, load that deliberate local replacement and stop applying this copy. Do not merge two skill definitions implicitly.
3. Otherwise use this canonical skill.
4. Read `.projects/project.md`. If it is missing during ordinary administration, stop and identify the missing repository contract. For an explicit setup or adoption request, create it through the onboarding workflow and repository-contract reference instead of guessing topology from a repository name, issue title, Project title or previous run.
5. In a shell-capable environment, run `scripts/validate-contract.sh REPOSITORY_ROOT` before relying on the contract.

Read [the repository contract reference](references/repository-contract.md) when creating, migrating, validating, or interpreting `.projects/` files.

## Resolve exactly one context

- A `single` contract resolves directly.
- A `dispatcher` contract must resolve exactly one row by an explicit Project number, routing label, Project key, or other exact identifier supplied by the request or live issue state. Then read the referenced `.projects/projects/*.md` contract. A zero-route dispatcher is a valid onboarding state, not an operational Project context; for ordinary administration, stop and tell the operator to rerun the initializer and add a Project.
- All identifiers supplied by the user, contract, issue and Project must agree. Stop on zero matches, multiple matches, or disagreement.
- Treat live GitHub as authority for current issue, membership, field, option and hierarchy state. Treat `.projects/` as authority for topology, mappings, governance and source requirements.
- Retrieve an external source only when the local contract requires it for this operation. An exact requested change is not a scope-design task.

## Interpret short requests

A request such as `Set example#313 to P2.` supplies an exact target and desired value. It authorises only that delta. A request such as `What are the highest-priority open items in example?` is read-only.

Ask a question only when a missing fact would change the target or outcome. Do not ask the user to restate fresh inspection, narrow mutation, preservation, stale checks or readback requirements.

## Write issues at the configured level

The latest explicit user instruction about how much to write always overrides the repository setting for that request.

For issue creation or a substantial issue-body rewrite, read the optional `Issue write-up style` value from the resolved Project contract. If it is absent, use `tidy`. Supported values are:

- `unrestricted`: add useful grounded structure, context, implementation detail, acceptance criteria or decomposition when that materially improves the issue. Do not invent unsupported people, deadlines, scope, rationale or technical decisions.
- `tidy`: the default. Clean up wording and structure and make only small clarifications or expansions that follow directly from the request or required project sources. Do not introduce new scope, rationale, technical choices, people, deadlines, extra subtasks or acceptance criteria unless they were supplied or are necessary to preserve meaning.
- `minimal`: keep the issue minimal and direct. Correct obvious wording errors and use only enough structure to make the requested work readable. Do not add contextual paragraphs, inferred rationale, implementation ideas, acceptance criteria, extra subtasks, people, deadlines or technical decisions that the user did not state.

If a contract supplies any other value, stop and identify the unsupported setting instead of silently choosing a style.

## Use Class and Workstream for different questions

When creating, refining or applying Class or Issue Type and Workstream values, follow [the Class and Workstream design reference](references/class-and-workstreams.md).

- Class answers what kind of work item this is. `Task` is the normal default when no more specific type adds value.
- `Epic` is a broad coordination outcome, not a synonym for top-level issue or parent issue. Parenthood and Class are independent, so a Task, Deliverable, Analysis or other type may have sub-issues without becoming an Epic.
- Workstream answers which stable functional lane the issue belongs to. Do not use it to duplicate Class, Priority, Status, one-off milestones, routing labels or sub-project labels.
- Prefer a concise, stable vocabulary and preserve useful existing local distinctions. Starter profiles and preferred colours are guidance, not a requirement to rewrite every Project.
- Colour is presentational. Reuse provider-supported colours when categories outnumber distinct colours; colour uniqueness must not block ordinary administration unless the local contract explicitly makes a palette exact.

Use this default common Priority vocabulary unless the resolved contract declares a complete override:

| Common value | Provider value |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | Urgent |
| P1 | High |
| P2 | Medium |
| P3 | Low |

Mappings must be one-to-one. Never collapse two provider values into one common value or use different read and write mappings. Discover the exact live provider option before a write and stop if it does not match the contract.

An initial repository contract may instead say `Priority mapping status: pending`. This preserves the Project's existing field and options during onboarding. Do not rank, interpret or change Priority while that marker remains. Confirm the provider location, inspect the live options, propose a complete one-to-one mapping, and record both in the contract before any Priority operation. Changing the live option set is a separate mutation and requires explicit authority.

For single-select option colours, follow any exact palette in the repository contract. If none is declared and the choice is only presentational, choose stable colours that fit the option meanings without asking the user to design a palette. Preserve useful existing colours. Read [the repository contract reference](references/repository-contract.md) when creating or changing option definitions.

## Choose an execution surface

Use the first capable surface:

1. a future `projects` CLI, or `projectscli` if that is the installed name;
2. proven native `gh` commands, versioned GitHub REST, and GraphQL;
3. an equivalent authenticated provider connector that can perform the same inspection and independent readback.

The future CLI is optional and does not exist merely because this skill mentions it. Until it is available, use the direct operations in [the GitHub operations reference](references/github-operations.md).

If the current surface cannot perform an authorised mutation, inspect as far as safely possible and return the smallest executable command block that completes the operation. Use placeholders only for facts that cannot be discovered. Do not claim that returned commands ran.

Copy-and-paste command handoffs must be safe to paste into an interactive shell. Do not include command-wide shell-option changes such as `set -e`, `set -u`, `set -o pipefail`, `set -euo pipefail`, or combined variants. Prefer ordinary commands that leave the caller's shell behaviour unchanged. If a shell-state change is genuinely required, scope it to a subprocess so it does not persist after the command finishes.

Run `scripts/setup.sh` when preparing an environment or when `gh` prerequisites are missing. The host must provide credentials and network access. Never print, persist, transform or request a token in a prompt.

When adopting the skill in a repository that does not yet have `.projects/project.md`, run `scripts/init-project.sh` from that repository. It discovers live GitHub facts, asks only for local choices, writes the first single-Project contract or an empty multi-Project dispatcher, and adds a bounded `AGENTS.md` routing section. For a dispatcher, it offers to add Projects one at a time, discovering each live Project and asking only for its routing identity. Rerunning it can add another Project without replacing current routes. It never mutates live issues, labels or Projects.

## Inspect and plan

For every target issue, read the current:

- stable issue identity, URL and state;
- Project identity and membership;
- affected field definition, location, option and current value;
- labels, assignees, milestone and relevant native hierarchy;
- any other state the proposed operation could replace or remove.

State the exact requested delta. Separate it from necessary implied changes. Adding Project membership is an implied change only when the requested Project field cannot exist without it and the contract authorises membership.

For a read-only ranking, translate provider values through the resolved mapping and order P0, P1, P2, then P3. Apply any requested tie-breaker; otherwise report the tie rather than inventing precision.

## Apply a mutation safely

Before writing:

1. discover current IDs and options rather than reusing IDs from documentation or a previous run;
2. re-read the stale-sensitive target immediately before the write;
3. compare it with the inspected state and stop if the target, membership, affected value or preservation set changed;
4. use the narrowest endpoint or command that changes only the authorised field;
5. preserve every unrequested field, label, assignee, milestone, relationship, body, comment and Project membership.

Do not replace a whole collection when an additive or field-specific operation exists. Do not remove Project membership without explicit authority because doing so also removes Project-local values. Do not retry an uncertain create or mutation blindly.

After writing, perform a separate targeted read. A successful mutation response is not verification. Report success only when the independently observed value equals the requested provider-native value and the preservation set remains intact.

Stop on ambiguity, missing permission, stale state, unavailable required sources, an unexpected collateral change, or failed readback.

## Report

For a read, report the resolved context, relevant values, ranking rule and any unavailable field.

For a write, report separately:

- requested delta;
- applied delta;
- independent readback;
- preserved state relevant to the mutation;
- any remaining manual action.

Keep private issue content within its authorised repository and surface. Never copy credentials or private task details into a public issue, PR, log or evidence report.

When authoring ChatGPT Project or another provider's standing instructions, follow [the provider instruction reference](references/provider-project-instructions.md). Keep that layer as a pointer, not a second copy of this procedure.
