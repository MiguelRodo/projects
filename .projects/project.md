## Governance

- This repository contributes only to MiguelRodo Project #40 (`projects`). Repository identity is sufficient routing, so do not add a `project:*` label merely to duplicate Project membership.
- Native Project auto-add may match this repository directly. Agent-created issues should ensure Project #40 membership explicitly rather than depending on auto-add timing.
- The repository is public and the Project is private. Keep private material out of issues, pull requests, commits, logs and public reports.
- `pj:implement-chat` is a local implementation handoff label, not a Project-routing label. Queue issues are not Project items by default.
- Labels must not duplicate Class, Priority or Status.
- Assignment is explicit only.
- Exact requested administration and organising existing issues to this declared shape require no external source.
