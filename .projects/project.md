## Live target

- Class is a required single-select Project field with exactly the values and colours above.
- Priority is a required single-select Project field with exactly P0, P1, P2 and P3.
- Target date is optional and remains blank unless an issue has a real deadline.
- Use native parent and sub-issue relationships for roadmap hierarchy. Parenthood does not imply Epic.
- `Research`, `Raw data` and `Processed data` are retired Class values and are not part of the active vocabulary.
- Workstream is not part of the active contract and no live Workstream field is expected.

## Governance

- The repository is public and the Project is private. Keep private material out of issues, pull requests, commits, logs and public reports.
- Project membership is the routing mechanism. Do not add a label merely to duplicate membership.
- `pj:implement-chat` is a local implementation handoff label, not a Project-routing label. Queue issues are not Project items by default.
- Labels must not duplicate Class, Priority or Status.
- Assignment is explicit only.
- Read issue #1 for the roadmap and issue #67 for the current architecture before inventing scope or changing roadmap meaning.
- Exact requested administration and organising existing issues to this declared shape require no external source.
