# Contributing to `projects`

Thank you for contributing. The active product surface is the agent-neutral
`github-project-admin` skill, with the optional `projects` CLI for repeated
operations that benefit from one tested implementation.

## Start with the authoritative issue

Before working:

1. Read [issue #1](../../issues/1) for the execution order.
2. Read [issue #67](../../issues/67) for the post-dogfood architecture.
3. Select one open leaf issue whose dependencies are complete.
4. Treat the exact files and interfaces named by that issue as the change boundary.

If a required decision is absent or contradictory, stop and describe the conflict in the PR.

## Pull-request discipline

- Work on one issue per pull request.
- Create a branch and open a PR against `main`; do not push directly to `main`.
- Change only the files permitted by the issue.
- Do not include unrelated cleanup or anticipatory abstractions.
- Keep the PR description aligned with the actual diff.
- Use `Refs #N` until every completion condition is met; use `Closes #N` only when the PR genuinely completes the issue.

## Public boundary

Skills, code, schemas, documentation and fixtures must remain agent-neutral and operator-neutral.

Do not include:

- private repository names;
- private Drive, document or spreadsheet identifiers;
- credentials, tokens or secret material;
- personal names or account-specific configuration;
- private source locations or private destination URLs.

Use clearly synthetic fixtures and local test doubles.

## Skill changes

Keep the main `SKILL.md` concise and route detailed provider commands or conditional guidance to `references/`. Put deterministic repeated logic in `scripts/` and test it offline.

Validate the canonical skill with:

```bash
python /path/to/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py \
  skills/github-project-admin
bash skills/github-project-admin/tests/run.sh
```

The first command uses the validator distributed with the Agent Skill authoring tools. CI runs the repository-owned offline checks.

Tests must not mutate live GitHub issues, Projects, repositories or private systems. Use synthetic fixtures and fake commands.

## CLI boundary

The executable is named `projects`. It is an optional backend for the skill,
not a separate repository contract or a required collaborator tool. Add a CLI
operation only when a real repeated failure supports it, then keep the direct
provider and repository-script path available where practical.

Do not create a second executable, restore the discarded workspace manager, or
move agent-launcher behaviour from `pj` into this binary without revising issue
#3 first.
